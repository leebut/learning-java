# Data Types

There are several _primitive_ data types that include:

- **Strings**: String, char
- **Numbers**: byte, short, int, long, float, double
- **boolean**

## Strings

Strings are declared with `String variableName =` note the capital 'S'.
[[string_methods]]
## Numbers

Number variables are declared as for strings other than the capital letter is not required, nor are the quotes.
### Float and double
`float` and `double handle decimal numbers`.
### Decimal precision
**A note on decimal precision:** Floats must end with '**f**' for float and '**d**' for double.
A float of `3.14f` can have up to 6 decimal digits, whereas `3.14d` can have about 15.
